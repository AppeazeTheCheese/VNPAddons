This is an addon for the [VanishNoPacket](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vanish/) plugin that uses ProtocolLib in order to hide vanished players from the auto-complete list for all commands, as well as prevent vanished players from announcing achievements or advancements in chat.

**Bungee Support in Progress**
